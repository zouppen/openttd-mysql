================================
OpenTTD console to MySQL gateway
================================

Author: Joel Lehtonen, joel.lehtonen ät jyu.fi

Description:
============

A gateway from OpenTTD console to MySQL database. Another project that
has the same goal is Autopilot (http://wiki.openttdcoop.org/Autopilot).
Maybe in future they may use the same database schema. Pick the one
that suits your needs. :-)

It is important to notice if you put this logger running on a server
you need to provide your users the source code of this product. If you
haven't made any modifications, you can link to the original git
repository at http://iki.fi/zouppen/repo/openttd-mysql.git . If you
are running a modified copy, you need offer your source code. This can
be done for example by putting a link to the source in your OpenTTD
statistics page.

Installation:
=============

OpenTTD
-------

Patching OpenTTD is needed for getting more sophisticated company
statistics. The required patch is not yet part of OpenTTD. Without
patching you are getting only joins, leaves and private messages to
the database. Note: You don't need to patch the clients. Players may
use unpatched OpenTTD.

Get the sources of OpenTTD from http://www.openttd.org/ and patch them
with http://users.jyu.fi/~jasavilh/openttd/openttd_output.patch.100106 .
Compile and install as root or as your user with --prefix.

Start OpenTTD as user once to generate initial config:

$ openttd

Edit ~/.openttd/openttd.cfg and verify you have English as server's
language. Change language variable to:

  language = english.lng

This is important for the parser to work. You may still use your
native language in game.

If you are running the server and client as the same user (which is
not recommended anyway) you can write a separate configuration file
for your dedicated server. How to do that is your homework. :-)

MySQL
-----

Install and configure mysql if you haven't done so yet. Instruction
can be found at http://www.mysql.com/ or from the documentation of
your Linux distribution.

Make a new mysql user or give at least INSERT privilege to that
database.

Create a new database. You may call the database 'openttd'. You can
setup initial tables by executing the SQL commands at
'misc/initial.sql'.

mysql-connector-java
--------------------

Download mysql-connector-java from
http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/. You may also use your
Linux distributor's package, if available. Version 5.0 is good enough.

You can install mysql-connector-java as an ordinary user, too.

openttd-mysql
-------------

Compile all java files in the directory where openttd-mysql is:

$ javac *.java

Fill in database.conf and launch.conf with your favourite
editor. These files should be very self-explanatory.

$ cp database.conf.example database.conf
$ cp launch.conf.example launch.conf
$ emacs database.conf launch.conf   #or vim, nano, ...

You need to know the screenlog file name in launch.conf. Read the
following chapter first if you have problems.

Usage
=====

Start OpenTTD server in a screen or other facility where it is
possible to log everything that the server outputs. Start screen with -L
or use the the script set I have made for running OpenTTD dedicated
and scheduled server. For the script, see scripts/ directory.

If you have different kind of logging (for example using pipes or
netcat) you can modify launch.sh for your needs. If you use just
screen logging, you can start openttd-mysql by running:

$ ./launch.sh

Remember to start OpenTTD server, too!

Troubleshooting
===============

Q: Why openttd-mysql records only private messages but not company information? 
A: You may have forgotten to patch OpenTTD. Re-read installation chapter.

Q: Why openttd-mysql records only company information, but no private messaging?
A: Your OpenTTD dedicated server is not probably speaking English.

Miscellaneous
=============

First of all, I'd like to thank all the players in our
Linkkigames. You have helped a lot in creation of mysql statistics by
providing interesting data. Special thanks goes to Eladith and
Katajakasa. Eladith has created the patch for OpenTTD and Katajakasa
has made an interesting game statistics page from Linkkigames. It is
located at http://users.jyu.fi/~tutavirt/ttdstats/ .

You are welcome to mail me patches and even just say "Hello". :-) My
e-mail address is joel.lehtonen ät jyu.fi.
