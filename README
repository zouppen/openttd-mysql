OpenTTD console to MySQL gateway
Author: Joel Lehtonen, joel.lehtonen Ã¤t jyu.fi

Installation:
-------------

Download mysql-connector-java from somewhere. Version 5.0 is good enough.
Put jar to your CLASSPATH.

Compile all java files in this directory:

$ javac *.java

Generate tables to your database. Make a new user or give at least
INSERT privilege to that database. You may call the database 'openttd'.
Initial database setup can be found from the file 'misc/initial.sql'.

Fill in database.conf with your favourite editor:

$ cp database.conf.example database.conf
$ emacs database.conf    #or vim, nano, ...

Usage:
------

Start OpenTTD server in a screen or other facility where it is
possible to log everything that server outputs. Start screen with -L
or use the the script set I have made for running OpenTTD dedicated
and scheduled server.

To get company statistics to the database you need a 'whipper' which
pushes a command to the server in periodic intervals. See a file
'misc/whip' for details.

Find a location of your OpenTTD server log and adapt the following
line to your needs:

$ tail -n 0 -f ~/openttd/screenlog.0 | java LogReader

Other notes:
------------

PLEASE NOTE: This thing requires OpenTTD server language to be Finnish
for this thing to work. Switch it to Finnish or fix this software to
parse English messages and mail me a patch. :-)
