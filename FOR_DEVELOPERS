Needles
-------

If you are handling huge data masses with this thing you may be
interested how to filter only "meaningful" amount of rows. For example
in OpenTTData Stats written by Katajakasa there are graphs which take
a huge amount of data from the database. That can be avoided with
needles.

Think of needles as those in a haystack. You want to get only some of
the data, ignoring the rest. Picking by needles is not super accurate,
filtering usually returns more data than requested. But the amount of
data is never 2 times more than requested.

First, you need to know how much data you need. For example, if you
are plotting 100 pixels wide statistics of companies and time runs
horizontally, your choice would be 100. If you get more data, at most
199 data points, that won't be bad. The graphics library will
interpolate them for you.

So, let's get at least 100 quarter statistics from a game_id 3. You
can get the optimal needle by quering:

SELECT optimal_limit(COUNT(DISTINCT gamedate),100)
       FROM company_stats WHERE game_id = 3
       INTO @needle;

This query returns the needle value. You can use that in your actual
query:

SELECT * FROM company_stats WHERE game_id = 3 AND needle >= @needle;

In my case, that returns rows from 152 distinct quarters. Because
100<152<200, the query seems to work!

Have fun with query optimization!
