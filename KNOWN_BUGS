#1: Company parameters
----------------------

In table company there is a problem if a company picks same name it
has had previously. Then there should be a new row containing the new
name. Because table key prevents same values, it is not supported.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Start a new company
2. Wait for database update
3. Rename your company
4. Wait for database update
5. Pick a name you had at first
6. The database is not updated, the last row contains wrong company name

Possible fix:

Replace 'insert ignore' with a procedure which inserts a new line only
if it is different from the previous one. Values need not to be
unique.
